This module works best with certain tswow modifications, without them you will need to build addons, copy them to datasets/realm/aio/ manually and then rebuild addon with the aio files commented out to build a empty addon file, eliminating doubles

With the tswow modifications, all copying/duplicates is done for you, just `build addon` and `aio reload` and you're good to go
